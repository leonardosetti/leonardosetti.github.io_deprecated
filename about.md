My name is Leonardo Setti, but you can call me Leo or Setti. Technology has fascinated me since the early 2000s, when I wondered "*how does the internet work?*" or "*what would happen if I pressed this button*?

Because of this curiosity, I became a software quality engineer, working in software engineering since 2008 until now. I am also passionate about open source software and a few Linux distributions and their package ecosystem!

#### The sound of inevitability

As I am involved in software development, quality assurance, and a lot of reverse engineering, there is one thing I cannot avoid or escape: **coding!** It is ubiquitous these days, and as part of my desired skills, it is there: ***test automation*** and everything that comes with it, acronyms, patterns, techniques, older or newer programming languages, frameworks, approaches, tools, methodologies, and so on. Yes! It is a colossal pile of things we are supposed to know and, of course, experienced.

But there is another side to it: the character, the main actor with the experience and confidence to achieve new knowledge, the soft skills over the hard skills.

So, now I am struggling and working hard to reach the level of automation hero and all those shiny pendants!
_And, I'll be there!_
