With a rich history spanning fifteen years dedicated to Quality Software Assurance, I bring a meticulous and detail-oriented approach to my professional endeavors. My expertise initially revolved around Web-based applications, and over the last two years, I've thoughtfully expanded my portfolio to encompass mobile apps as well.

My professional journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of QA processes, making me adept at navigating the intricate landscape of software quality assurance. I possess a keen analytical perspective that extends to both software systems and processes. This acumen, coupled with my unwavering commitment to best communication practices, allows me to integrate new technical knowledge and adapt behavior as needed seamlessly.

I take pride in my ability to swiftly and effectively align with diverse methodologies, environments, and work schemas. A noteworthy aspect of my interests is my fervent enthusiasm for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which further fuels my passion for all things software-related.
