This repository contains an HTML template for creating a personal portfolio website. The template includes a top menu, theme toggle, a central panel with a carousel, and contact links.

## Files

- `styles/styles.css`: The main CSS file containing the general styling of the page.

## Themes

Different color themes can be applied using the theme toggle. The available themes are:
- Gruvbox Dark
- Monokai

To add more themes or customize the existing ones, create separate CSS files for each theme.

2. Customize the content in `index.html` according to your preferences.
3. Edit the CSS files in the `styles` folder to modify the appearance of the page.
